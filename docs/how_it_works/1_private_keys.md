# Private Keys

AnyFlow does not ask your private keys to deploy your smart contracts. Instead, we use our own. This way, you don't have to worry about managing your private keys being exposed or stolen. Our private keys are stored in a secure vault, and we only use them to deploy your smart contracts.

In the near future, we plan to allow you to customize the signing process, so you can use your own private keys, external wallets, hardware wallets, and multi-sig wallets. This also ensures a more secure deployment process by allowing you to have full control over the signing process.

Please note that we only use the keys to deploy your smart contract. You should always transfer the ownership of the contract to your own account during the deployment process.

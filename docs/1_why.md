# Why AnyFlow?

### Vision

AnyFlow's vision is to become the go-to platform for all blockchain deployment and management needs. We aim to provide a seamless experience for both developers and non-tech users to deploy, manage, and monitor their smart contracts on multiple blockchains.

### The Old Way

We feel that the current smart contract deployment process are filled with tasks not directly related to the development of the smart contract. Not to mention the risks involved in managing the financial and operational aspects of the deployment in the developer's machine. And issues communicating with non-tech team members who need to manage the contracts and understand the contract's status.

### The New Way

We want to remove these tasks from your workflow and let you focus on what you do best: building amazing smart contracts. Let the financial and operational tasks be handled by us while we provide your non-tech team members with a user-friendly interface to manage the contracts.

Our platform is currently designed to save you time and effort by automating the deployment process and providing a user-friendly interface to manage your contracts. But in the future, we plan to offer more advanced features and tools to help you manage your smart contracts more efficiently no matter your level of expertise.
